###INTRODUCTION

####About JAVA
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. Java is one of the most popular programming language in use mainly for client-server web applications.

####About Object Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented programming (OOP) is the type of programming in which programmers define the data type of a data structure and the type of operations that can be applied to the data structure.
The building blocks of object-oriented programming are Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.


###PROJECT – RESTAURENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

A restaurant management system is a collective term for software that helps streamline food business operations. Namely, restaurants, bars, bakeries, cafes, kitchens, food trucks or delivery businesses.
Our application offers the following features when executed

####Main window
 
It starts with the restaurant info window which asks for login. 


####Login

The login window asks for staff/manager username and password.
The following window shows the buttons – Show Menu, Order management, Manage employees etc. 


####Menu

This window displays the items the restaurant offers and the price of each item.
Managers also can add, edit, or delete new items into the menu through the manage menu item tab


####Ordering Items

To take a new order, we select by adding items from the menu, and program asks to enter the quantity. 
We can also edit, delete items from the order if required.
Our application also offers to cancel the whole order


####Manage employees
 
Managers can add, edit, and delete staff.
Each staff has a unique userID and password which they can login to the system with.


####Payments
 
Only managers can see the transactions. The staff can only take the order and checkout.
Payment details can be seen by clicking "Show payment" button.









###APPLICATIONS OF OUR PROGRAM


####Easy to use.
-	All the tasks are done with a button and the program does the rest.


####Staff check in
-	The software lets the manager know from when the employees have started their shift.


####Reduction of errors.
-	As every order is shown in the display, chances of errors happening are very less as compared to when writing down the orders.


####Enhanced Productivity
-	The application deals with time consuming tasks such as sales and double checking the disparities in sales


###CONCEPTS USED


####Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a mechanism where java binds our data and code it together as a single unit. It also means to hide the data in order to make it safe from any modification. 
Encapsulation can be achieved by:
•	Declaring the variables of a class as private.
•	Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.


####Inheritance

Inheritance is one such concept where the properties of one class can be inherited by the other. It helps to reuse the code and establish a relationship between different classes. There are two classes: -

1. Parent class (Super or Base class)
2. Child class (Subclass or Derived class)
A class which inherits the properties is known as Child Class whereas a class whose properties are inherited is known as Parent class.  


####Abstraction

In Java, Data Abstraction is defined as the process of reducing the object to its essence so that only the necessary characteristics are exposed to the users. An Abstract class is a class whose objects can’t be created. An Abstract class is created using the abstract keyword


####Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations


####Exceptions 

An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e., at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions.


####GUI

GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. A program's graphical user interface presents an easy-to-use visual display to the user. It is made up of graphical components (e.g., buttons, labels, windows) through which the user can interact with the page or application.
